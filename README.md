##  Task-1 Prediction using Supervised ML


__Problem statments__

● predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day

● dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data


__Solution__



##  Task-2 Visulization


__Problem statments__

● predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox


__Solution__



##  Task-3 EDA


__Problem statments__

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

● dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

__Solution__


##  Task-4 EDA


__Problem statments__

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

● dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

__Solution__


##  Task-5 EDA

__Problem statments__

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’

● As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.

● Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.

● dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b

__Solution__


##  Task-6 Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

__Problem statments__

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

● dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

__Solution__



##  Task-7 Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis


__Problem statments__

● Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines

● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)

● dataset: 

Download historical stock prices from https://finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1

Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
